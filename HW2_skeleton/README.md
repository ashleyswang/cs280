Everything is implemented with the usage specified in the assignment handout (a/d to rotate, -r to save image).

Extra credit is completed. You can use the extra credit function by using the -v option with the vector coordinates to rotate about.

ie. ./Rasterizer -v x y z

You can still use a/d to rotate about the axis.
